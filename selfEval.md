# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

I tend to get hung up on trying to perfect my work. Even if 90% of my code is working and I have 1 part I am stuck on, Ill spend too much time trying to resolve it myself.  Im working on becoming better at setting a hard stop before reaching out for help. 

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
Let's say I'm teaching my 5 year old how to wash a load of laundry. In order to do so we could write down the instructions on a piece of paper and store in one of the drawers in our laundry room.  Each time he wanted to repeat that task he could open the drawer in order to retrieve the directions.
